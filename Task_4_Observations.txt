### Observations for Task 4 - Part 1: Substantive Testing

#### 1. Balance Sheet Discrepancies
- Differences between total assets and total liabilities + equity, indicating an imbalance.

- Presence of negative balances where they are not expected (e.g., negative cash or retained earnings).
- Misclassification of assets or liabilities.

#### 2. Number of Journals Posted by Finance Team Employees
- Excessive journal entries in the closing period, which may indicate adjustments to manipulate financials.
- Unusual patterns, such as multiple entries by the same employee near period-end.
- Lack of proper segregation of duties (e.g., the same person posting and approving entries).
- Repeated manual adjustments, which could suggest system errors or misstatements.

#### 3. Key Financial Metrics from Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet
- Significant variances in revenue, expenses, or profit margins compared to previous years or budgets.
- Unexplained increases in expenses, especially in discretionary categories.
- High levels of receivables or slow-moving inventory, suggesting potential write-offs.
